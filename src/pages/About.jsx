                            At Connect To Blood, we're committed to saving lives through the power
                            of blood donation. Our mission is to provide a safe, reliable, and
                            convenient way for donors to give blood and for patients to receive the
                            life-saving transfusions they need. With a dedicated team of staff and
                            volunteers, as well as partnerships with leading organizations in the
                            healthcare industry, we're working to create a world where every patient
                            has access to the blood products they need.
